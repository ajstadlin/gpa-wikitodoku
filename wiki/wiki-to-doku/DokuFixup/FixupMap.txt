# DokuFixup Document Fixup Mapping - Updated Sep 26, 2016
# ================================
# This is a data file required by DokuFixup.  This file is copied to the application startup folder by Build.
#
# The Source files should be already converted by pandoc from markdown_github to dokuwiki.
# The DokuFixup program will fixup the DokuWiki formatted files.  
#   For example, the ".md" extension will be removed from relative file links since that extension is not used in the GPA DokuWiki
#
# Path is relative to the Application.Startup Path
#   In this Project Repository, the Application.Startup Path = REPOSITORY_ROOT/wiki/wiki-to-doku/DokuFixup/bin/Debug
#   For examples:
#     wiki/openpdc relative path = ../../../../../wiki/openpdc
#     doku/openpdc relative path = ../../../../../doku/openpdc
#
# Links will be detected by their "](link)" syntax. 
# The following data read into a table in the DokuFixup application.
# For each Source File
#   For each Original Link in the Table : Search an Replace with its corresponding Replacement Link
# After links are replaced, save the Updated Source to its corresponding Destination File
# 
# Each file being fixed should only have one row in the list below.
# If you need to replace additional links not related to a file, use the following syntax replacing filenames with "null"
# null * null * ORIGINAL_LINK * REPLACEMENT_LINK
#...................................................................................................
# SOURCE_PATH_FILE * DESTINATION_PATH_FILE * ORIGINAL_LINK * REPLACEMENT_LINK
