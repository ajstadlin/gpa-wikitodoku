Open Source Phasor Data Concentrator

The [[https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/products.asp#PDC|openPDC]] administered by the [[https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/|Grid Protection Alliance]] (GPA) is a complete Phasor Data Concentrator software system designed to process streaming time-series data in real-time. Measured data gathered with GPS-time from many hundreds of input sources is time-sorted and provided to user defined actions as well as to custom outputs for archival.

====== Overview ======

A phasor data concentrator is designed to receive streaming synchrophasor data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed on power transmission lines and align this data by GPS time-tag (i.e., it "concentrates" the data based on time). The output of a PDC is a time-synchronized dataset that is forwarded on one or more software applications. For more information on the functional requirements of a PDC see: [[http://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/docs/products/openPDC/C37.244-2013.pdf|Phasor Data Concentrator Requirements]]

The openPDC is much more than just a data concentrator, it is a flexible platform for processing high-speed time-series data that can adapt with changing technology to provide a future-proof phasor data architecture. The openPDC can be used to distribute data (both real-time and historical) to consuming applications and can be installed anywhere within the synchrophasor infrastructure, even on fanless computers that run in a substation environment.

Although the primary purpose of the openPDC is concentration and management of real-time streaming synchrophasors, by having its functionality based on GPA's [[http://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/technology.asp#TSL|Time-Series Library]] the openPDC inherits a modular design that allows it to be classified as a generic [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_stream_processing|event stream processor:]]

====== Features ======

The openPDC implements a number of standard phasor protocols which can be used to receive data from devices. The supported protocols include IEEE C37.118, IEC 61850-90-5, IEEE 1344, BPA PDCstream, F-NET, SEL Fast Message, and Macrodyne among others.

Using the [[http://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/technology.asp#TSL|Time-Series Library]], the openPDC can be configured to archive to any historian system, however, the system also includes an available built-in historian, the openHistorian, for data archival. The local historian comes with a visualization and extraction tool, a high-speed local API and web services, all of which can be used to extract and monitor the data being archived in real-time. The files produced by the historian can also be [[https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openPDC/blob/master/Source/Documentation/wiki/Developers_Using_Hadoop.md|analyzed using Hadoop]].

With version 2.1 or later, the openPDC can be deployed in [[http://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/docs/products/openPDC/openPDConPOSIX.pdf|POSIX environments]] as well as on Windows.
