<h3><a name="pmu_connection_tester"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Where can I find the installer for the PMU Connection Tester?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The latest installer for the PMU Connection Tester can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openPDC/tree/master/Source/Documentation/wiki/Nightly_Builds.md">Nightly Builds</a>. See the
<a href="https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openPDC/tree/master/Source/Documentation/wiki/PMU_Connection_Tester.md">PMU Connection Tester</a> documentation page for more information.</p>
<h4><a name="openpdc_build_scripts"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Does the openPDC provide build scripts?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Yes, the entire build process is command line driven and currently the only files that are checked-out and checked-in are the version files (AssemblyInfo.*); we do not archive the build binaries in source
 control because the build script allows for building a specific version by passing in the version specs to the build script from the command line. The Build.bat file is just a simple wrapper that calls the MSBuild script and proxies the command line parameter
 for the BuildInteractive property that can be used for the build to take place in &ldquo;unattended&rdquo; mode (nice for automated nightly builds).<br>
<br>
The one trick to getting the build script to work correctly apart from having the required tools (mentioned in openPDC\Contributor Resources\Tools\Build Tools\Readme.txt) installed is to make sure that the build machine has an entry for the CodePlex TFS login
 credentials in Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Advanced tab &gt; Manage Passwords or else the build script might fail if the credentials have not been entered prior to the build by accessing CodePlex TFS from inside Visual Studio (see:
<a href="http://codeplex.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Using%20TFS%20and%20Team%20Explorer%20with%20CodePlex&referringTitle=Home#Password">
Saving Password in Team Explorer</a>).<br>
<br>
Almost all the properties used by the build script can be overridden from the command line and the way this can be done is to run the build script from command line and overriding the default property values using the /p switch like:<br>
C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\msbuild.exe Synchrophasor.buildproj /p:SkipHelpFiles=Yes;BuildDeployFolder=&quot;C:\Build&rdquo;<br>
A full list of overridable properties can be seen in the Master.buildproj file, but here are some handy ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>SkipHelpFiles &ndash; Yes or any other text to skip building the help docs. </li><li>BuildDeployFolder &ndash; Final destination of the build output; build output is always available where the build takes place (by default this is c:\windows\temp\msbuild\openpdc).
</li><li>BuildFlavor &ndash; Debug or Release. </li><li>SourceVersion &ndash; Specific version of the source code to be built. For example: C31221 to build committed changes up to changeset #31221.
</li><li>ForceBuild &ndash; true to force a build even if there are no new changes since the last successful build (By default the build process will be skipped if no new changes have been committed since the last successful build).
</li></ul>

<h4><a name="openpdc_on_64bit"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Can I run the openPDC on a 64-bit OS?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Yes, but if you are using Access for your system configuration database you must run openPDC as a 32-bit application. We recommend using SQL Server, MySQL or other database in production so that you
 can run as a 64-bit application.</p>
<p>Note that later versions of the openPDC, starting at 2.0, only support 64-bit installations on Windows platforms. SQLite is the recommended &quot;no installation required&quot; database for new versions of openPDC.</p>
<h4><a name="openpdc_x86_targets"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Why does the openPDC include x86 platform targets?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: This is to force the build outputs to run as a 32-bit app on a 64-bit system so that it will also work with Access if needed. AnyCPU targets cause applications to run as 64-bit on 64-bit systems and
 32-bit on 32-bit systems - x86 forces 32-bit operation on 32-bit or 64-bit systems.<br>
<br>
The automated nightly build forces a complete x86 build of the entire system (available as openPDCSetup.msi (x86) - opposed to openPDCSetup64.msi (AnyCPU)) so that when you install the 32-bit version of the openPDC on a 64-bit system, it will run as a 32-bit
 system that will work with Access, even though you are on a 64-bit server.<br>
<br>
Also, you change the target output for the entire solution in Visual Studio to x86 (this is a local user setting) and run with an Access database for your configuration.</p>
<h4><a name="openpdc_on_low_performance_machines"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Can I run the openPDC on low-performance machines?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Yes, but you may need to lower the process priority of the openPDC to High instead of RealTime in order to prevent locking of the system on single-core machines, particularly if you've chosen to use
 a MySQL database for your openPDC configuration. There is a setting in the configuration file (openPDC.exe.config, found in the
<a href="https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openPDC/tree/master/Source/Documentation/wiki/Getting_Started.md#install_directory">
installation directory</a>) that you can use to change the process priority of the openPDC.<br>

<h2><a name="synchrophasor"></a>Synchrophasor Questions</h2>
<h3><a name="synchrophasor_openpdc"></a>openPDC Questions</h3>
<h3><a name="synchrophasor_connection_is_to_concentrator"></a>What happens to a device when you set a device&rsquo;s &ldquo;Connection is to Concentrator&rdquo; property to true?</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The &quot;Connection is to Concentrator&quot; property designates the device connection as having more than one device in a frame since a connection to multiple devices for a single connection has to
 be handled a little differently than a connection that contains a connection to a single device. Think of it this way: the openPDC models every device (i.e., PMU) regardless of its source - that is, whether the device came by proxy through a concentrator or
 directly it has its own definition. The connection information can then either be associated with device itself (direct connection) or its parent concentrator (which is also technically a &quot;device&quot;) - so the flag simply defines if the connection has
 data or if the connection contains devices which have data. If you check this box the system will expect to have some children devices defined for it (even if only one).</p>
<h4><a name="initial_vs_sample_database"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: What is the difference between the initial data set and the sample data set?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Please note the following table.<br>
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Database Type</th>

<h4><a name="synchrophasor_sql_server_cannot_see_changes"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: I set up the SQL Server Management Studio and executed the SQL files, but how do I see the changes I made?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: In the Object Explorer view on the left, right-click on &quot;Databases&quot; and select &quot;Refresh&quot;. The openPDC database will now show up in the list of Databases.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="synchrophasor_device_acronym_unique"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Does the Device ACRONYM need to be unique? The modeling instructions don't say so, but they do say that it is how the device is referenced by the
 program.</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Yes, this acronym must be unique. It becomes a key part of the signal reference used to identify and associate measurements to their PMU values.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="what_are_status_flags"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: What are the status flags measurements that are defined for each device?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The status flags measurement is a double-word bitmapped flag contained in each frame that holds data about the device and its measurements.<br>
<br>
<strong>Upper Word</strong> - This is an &lsquo;Abstracted&rsquo; set of flags that are consistent across all devices regardless of their protocol for reporting to the openPDC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bits 31&ndash;21: Reserved </li><li>Bit 20: Data discarded : 0 when data is discarded from the real-time stream due to late arrival.
</li><li>Bit 19: Data valid : 0 when PMU data is valid, 1 when invalid or PMU is in test mode.
</li><li>Bit 18: Synchronization valid : 0 when in device is in sync, 1 when it is not.
</li><li>Bit 17: Data sorting : 0 by time stamp, 1 by arrival. </li><li>Bit 16: Device error (including configuration error) : 0 when in error. </li></ul>
<p><br>
<strong>Lower Word</strong> - These are the 'Original' set of status flags reported by device itself and would therefore be protocol specific.<br>
For the IEEE C37.118 protocol, this lower byte has the following mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit 15: Data valid - 0 when PMU data is valid, 1 when invalid or PMU is in test mode.
</li><li>Bit 14: PMU error including configuration error - 0 when no error. </li><li>Bit 13: PMU sync - 0 when in sync. </li><li>Bit 12: Data sorting - 0 by time stamp, 1 by arrival. </li><li>Bit 11: PMU trigger detected - 0 when no trigger. </li><li>Bit 10: Reserved for future common flags - presently set to 0. </li><li>Bits 09-06: Reserved for security - presently set to 0. </li><li>Bits 05-04: Unlocked time:
<ul>
<li>00 = sync locked, best quality </li><li>01 = Unlocked for 10 s </li><li>10 = Unlocked for 100 s </li><li>11 = Unlocked over 1000 s </li></ul>
</li><li>Bits 03-00: Trigger reason:
<ul>
<li>1111-1000 = Available for user definition </li><li>0111 = Digital </li><li>0110 = Reserved </li><li>0101 = df/dt high </li><li>0100 = Frequency high/low </li><li>0011 = Phase-angle diff </li><li>0010 = Magnitude </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h4><a name="synchrophasor_measurement_signalreference_unique"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Does the SignalReference field in the Measurement table need to be unique?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Like device acronyms, signal reference values must be unique (the database definitions should enforce this constraint). The signal reference creates an association between a unique individual signal
 (i.e., a measurement) and a channel value within a parsed frame of phasor data from a specific PMU.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="invalid_pointer_address"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: I receive an error like the following:</h4>
<p><br>
<strong>The system detected an invalid pointer address in attempting to use a pointer argument in a call.</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Recent Windows versions default to IPv6 addressing. You will need to either supply DNS or IPv6 addresses (e.g., ::1 which is the IPv6 equivalent of 127.0.0.1) or force IPv4 addressing. In order to force
 IPv4 addressing, either add interface=0.0.0.0 to the connection string or, if you are using the PMU Connection Tester, change ForceIPv4 to true in the PMU Connection Tester configuration.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="synchrophasor_device_substation_association"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Would data from a single PMU Device typically be used at more than one Substation? Or is a particular PMU strongly associated with a single
 Substation?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: PMU definitions in the system normally refer directly to a piece of field hardware which is typically located at a substation. The important concept is one definition for one physical device regardless
 of delivery mechanism (direct connection, within a concentration stream from a PDC, etc.) If the same device data comes in from multiple streams and it is desirable to capture all instances of the data - the device will have to be modeled and named separately
 for each stream (e.g., MYPMU-1, MYPMU-2). This may be useful for critical devices that have a primary and backup data flow.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="synchrophasor_concentrator_measurement_association"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: When the openPDC is collecting data from other PDCs, is the the parent (concentrator) device or the child device associated with
 a measurement?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Measurements are always associated with a PMU. The PDC record exists only to define the &quot;connection&quot; and which PMU's will arrive through this connection. After this it has no further purpose.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="synchrophasor_resynchronization_buffer"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Is it possible to configure the minimum and maximum time delays that the openPDC waits for the data of the PMUs in the system arrive (also known
 as the &quot;resynchronization buffer&quot;)?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Yes, the <strong>LagTime</strong> and
<strong>LeadTime</strong> columns in the OutputStream table are the &quot;resynchronization&quot; parameters. They operate is as follows:<br>
<br>
LagTime is a double precision number that defines the allowed past time deviation tolerance, in seconds (can be subsecond). It defines the time sensitivity to past measurement timestamps and is the number of seconds allowed before assuming a measurement timestamp
 is too old. This becomes the maximum amount of delay that can be introduced by the concentrator to allow time for data to flow into the system.<br>
<br>
LeadTime is a double precision number that defines the allowed future time deviation tolerance, in seconds (can be subsecond). It defines the time sensitivity to future measurement timestamps and is the number of seconds allowed before assuming a measurement
 timestamp is too advanced. This becomes the tolerated &#43;/- accuracy of the local clock to real-time.<br>
<br>
Because the measurements being received by remote phasor devices are usually measured relative to GPS time, these timestamps are typically more accurate than the local system clock. As a result, we can use the latest received timestamp as the best local time
 measurement we have (ignoring transmission delays); but, even these times can be incorrect so we still have to apply reasonability checks to these times. To do this, we use the local system time and the LeadTime value to validate the latest measured timestamp.
 If the newest received measurement timestamp gets too old or creeps too far into the future (both validated &#43; and - against defined lead time property value), we will fall back on local system time. Note that this creates a dependency on a fairly accurate
 local clock - the smaller the lead time deviation tolerance, the better the needed local clock accuracy. For example, a lead time deviation tolerance of a few seconds might only require keeping the local clock synchronized to an NTP time source; but, a sub-second
 tolerance would require that the local clock be very close to GPS time.<br>
<br>
Note that your lag time should be defined as it relates to the rate at which data is coming into the concentrator. Make sure you allow enough time for transmission of data over the network allowing any needed time for possible network congestion. Lead time
 should be defined as your confidence in the accuracy of your local clock (e.g., if you set lead time to 2, this means you trust that your local clock is within plus or minus 2 seconds of real-time.)<br>
<br>
The other important property is UseLocalClockAsRealTime which defines a flag that determines whether or not to use the local clock time as real time. You should only use your local system clock as real time if the time is locally GPS hardware-synchronized or
 if the incoming measurement values being sorted were not measured relative to a GPS-synchronized clock (e.g., non PMU device).<br>

<h4><a name="support_redundant_configurations"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: Does the openPDC support redundant configurations?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: There are two primary options for configuring the openPDC to support system redundancy using typical clustering technologies. When deployed as a Windows service, the openPDC supports both &ldquo;fail
 over&rdquo; and &ldquo;load balanced&rdquo; configurations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most common, and easiest to configure, redundancy deployment option will be the &ldquo;fail over&rdquo; cluster. In this mode, the openPDC is deployed on two systems: a primary and a hot stand-by. Both the primary and hot stand-by nodes will both share
 the same configuration and archive data to the same location, as only one of the systems will be active at one time. When one system fails or needs to go offline for maintenance, the other system is activated.
</li><li>Although more involved to set up and configure, the openPDC can be deployed in a load-balanced environment. In this mode, multiple openPDC instances are up and running simultaneously. Additionally, each open PDC would be set up in server mode, listening
 for incoming connections and/or streaming data. All incoming data would be passed to an openPDC via a data proxy. The data proxy could be set up as an adapter in a &ldquo;substation&rdquo; openPDC, then sent to the control center load-balanced openPDC cluster.
 The load balanced option also allows for all the openPDC data services to be &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; to clients based on load.

<h4><a name="different_connections_under_connetion_type"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: What is the difference between Active, Passive or Hybrid connections, as it appears in device status under Connection Type?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Connections to devices can be direct &ldquo;active&rdquo; (such as TCP or serial) or unattended &ldquo;passive&rdquo; (such as UDP). Both transports styles have their pros and cons. Active traffic is
 typically sent with a transport level CRC and will &ldquo;resend&rdquo; if a packet failed to transport; since this is data is time-sensitive in nature, this can cause live data streams to fall further and further behind over time. Because of this issue, active
 style connections are only recommended for smaller data payloads, like those delivered from a connection to a single device. Passive traffic is broadcast without concern about whether or not the intended recipient received the data. This has been described
 effectively as &ldquo;turning on the fire-hose&rdquo;. The good thing about a passive connection is that data stream will not fall behind; it doesn&rsquo;t care if you missed a packet. But, therein lies the primary issue with passive transports. More recent
 devices are supporting an active &ldquo;command&rdquo; channel and a passive &ldquo;data&rdquo; channel, a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; connection type which is ideal for protocols requiring control commands to request a configuration and/or start a data stream. Future
 protocol versions supporting this kind of dual connectivity should be able to solve all aforementioned transport issues with passive channel packet loss by allowing the command channel to re-request missed packets from a local short term archive. This would
 not necessarily be useful from a real-time perspective but would be valuable in making sure your archive was complete.<br>

<h4><a name="trouble_installing_manager"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: I receive an error saying &quot;The installer was interrupted before openPDC Manager could be installed. You need to restart the installer to try again.&quot;
 But when I restart, it simply tells me the same thing. What should I do?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: This could be that you simply need to run the installer as an administrator, if this is not the issue then the first thing to check is to make sure you have .NET 3.5 and IIS 4.0 or later installed on
 your system. Additionally, if you are using IIS 7, you need to install IIS 6 Management Compatibility by going to &quot;Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off &gt; Internet Information Service &gt; Web Management Tools &gt; IIS6 Management
 Compatibility&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you are still receiving this problem, you may need to register ASP.NET with IIS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate aspnet_regiis.exe in the &ldquo;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727&rdquo; directory.

<h4><a name="how_much_history_stored"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: I noticed that my history file seemed to stay the same size all of the time. Does it only store a certain amount of history?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The historian pre-allocates the data files it uses for writing time-series data and &ldquo;rolls over&rdquo; to a new file once the current file is full. The size along with other parameters of the historian
 data file can be configured in the openPDC config file under the &lt;archiveFile/&gt; section.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="historian_not_responding"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: How does the openPDC handle situations where a historian is not responding?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: In the event that a historian stops responding to the openPDC's attempts to send it data, the openPDC will buffer the data meant for that historian. The openPDC will attempt to re-establish communication
 to the historian with rolling connection attempts. When the connection to the historian is established the data will then be sent to the historian for archival.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="locally_cached_measurements"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: How does the openPDC handle the locally cached measurements?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: If the openPDC has cached measurements for a historian that does respond, the openPDC will push the entire cache of data to the historian as soon as the historian is reconnected &ndash; this data will
 be pushed to the historian as quickly as possible to relieve memory pressure. If the historian continues to not respond, the openPDC will start dropping the oldest data in order not to exceed a user configurable number of points in memory (this to avoid possible
 out-of-memory errors). The settings to control the number of points maintained in memory can be found in the openPDC configuration file (SOURCEDIR\Build\Output\Debug\Applications\openPDC\openPDC.exe.config where SOURCEDIR is the root directory of the source
 code). These numbers can be adjusted to a much higher levels on 64-bit machines with large amounts of available memory.<br>
<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The openPDC will send the entire cached measurement queue to the archiver therefore it is imperative that the space taken by cached points on the openPDC server cannot exceed the space available on the archive server.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: These settings will not appear in your configuration file until you run openPDC.exe for the first time.<br>

<h2><a name="hadoop"></a>Hadoop Questions</h2>
<h4><a name="what_is_hadoop"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: What is Hadoop?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: Hadoop is a framework for running applications on large clusters built from commodity hardware.<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="how_does_hadoop_relate_to_openpdc"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: How does Hadoop relate to the openPDC?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The openPDC is capable of collecting petabytes of synchrophasor data. On a standard desktop system, processing that data linearly can take hundreds of days. Hadoop will be utilized to process that data
 on many machines in parallel, greatly reducing the time needed by dividing the work among the nodes.</p>
<h4><a name="how_are_openpdc_and_hadoop_used"></a><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question</span>: How are Hadoop and openPDC used in production?</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Answer</span>: The following are references to using openPDC and Hadoop in production with both HDFS for cheap scalable storage and MapReduce for processing large amounts of time series data.</p>
